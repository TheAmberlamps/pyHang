# pyhang
Making this CLI game taught me a lot about Python fundamentals and was a great project to explore ideas such as scraping to get words, importing JSON, converting and writing to file.

I may resume work on this to implement dynamic scraping to get words but for the time being I am moving ahead with other projects to further develop my Python skills.
